# Hands On Session 27-01-23
In this tutorial you can find a python notebook and folder containg data to be read during the exercises.  
You need to copy the url of the python notebook into a Google Colab page to let it open and play around.  
The tutorial is made of two parts  

1.    Play on a model 2D potential with 3 minima and a saddle point
2.    Play with an actual molecule: Alanine dipeptide
3.    Play with a simple 1D potential and a simple Markov State Model

Thanks to Prof. B. Ensing and its group for which I was inspired using the Muller Brown potential to play around.  
Thanks to the PLUMED Consortium to which I taken part of the idea about the Alanine dipeptide exercise.
